# Minimal fractional representations of integers mod M

We say that the fraction N/D represents the integer x mod M iff x*D == N % M 
and x and M are relatively prime. Per this definition, each
relatively prime integer x has many possible fractional
representations.  We say that the fraction N/D is a minimal
representation of x if no smaller denominator results in a numerator
less then or equal to N.  We define a function for computing
fractional representations and prove that it generates minimal
fractions.  We also prove that every integer has a minimal fractional
representation such that both N and D are less than sqrt(M).
